<h1>Modular Multiplicative Inverse</h1>

<h2>Definition</h2>

<p>Suppose we are given a positive integer $m$. Consider the integers in module $m$ (i.e. all integers from $0$ to $m-1$). Then, for some integer $a$, we can find its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_multiplicative_inverse">Modular multiplicative inverse</a>, denoted by $a ^ {-1}$, which satisfy:</p>

<p>$a . a^{-1} \equiv 1 \; (mod \, m)$</p>

<p>We should note that the modular inverse does not always exist. For example, let $m = 4$, $a = 2$. Obviously we cannot find $a^{-1}$ satisfying the above equation. It can be proven that the modular inverse exists if and only if $a$ and $m$ are relatively prime (i.e. $gcd(a, m) = 1$).</p>

<p>In this article, we present two methods for finding the modular inverse in case it exists, and one method for finding all the modular inverse of all numbers in linear time.</p>

<h2>Finding the Modular Inverse using Extended Euclidean algorithm</h2>

<p>Consider the following equation (with unknown $x$ and $y$):</p>

<p>$a . x + m . y = 1$</p>

<p>This is known as <a href="./algebra/linear-diophantine-equation.html">Linear Diophantine equation of two variables</a>. As shown in the linked article, when $gcd(a, m) = 1$, the equation has a solution which can be found using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm">Extended Euclidean algorithm</a>. Note that $gcd(a, m) = 1$ is also the condition for the Modular inverse to exist.</p>

<p>Now, if we take module $m$ of both sides, we can get rid of $m . y$, and the equation becomes:</p>

<p>$a . x \equiv 1 \; (mod \, m)$</p>

<p>Thus, the Modular inverse of $a$ is $x$.</p>

<p>The implementation is as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="cpp">int x, y;
int g = extended_euclidean(a, m, x, y);
if (g != 1) cout &lt;&lt; "No solution!";
else {
    x = (x % m + m) % m;
    cout &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Finding the Modular Inverse using Binary exponention</h2>

<p>Another method for finding Modular Inverse is to use Euler's theorem, which is as follows:</p>

<p>$a ^ {\phi (m)} \equiv 1 \; (mod \, m)$</p>

<p>which is true when $a$ and $m$ are relatively prime. (Again, note that this was also our condition for Modular inverse to exist).</p>

<p>In the case when $m$ is a prime number, we have an even simpler equation from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat's_little_theorem">Fermat's little theorem</a>:</p>

<p>$a ^ {m - 1} \equiv 1 \; (mod \, m)$</p>

<p>Multiply both sides of the above 2 equations, we have the following results:</p>

<ul>
<li>For any module $m$: $a ^ {\phi (m) - 1} \equiv a ^{-1} \; (mod \, m)$</li>
<li>For a prime module $m$: $a ^ {m - 2} \equiv a ^ {-1} \; (mod \, m)$</li>
</ul>

<p>From these results, we can easily find the Modular inverse using the <a href="./basic/binary-exp.html">Binary exponential algorithm</a>, which works in time $O(log m)$.</p>

<p>Even though this method is easier to understand than the method described in previous paragraph, in the case when $m$ is not a prime number, we need to calculate Euler phi function, which involves factorization of $m$, which might be very hard. If the prime factorization of $m$ is known, then the complexity of this method is $O(log m)$.</p>

<h2>Finding all Modular Inverse of numbers in module $m$</h2>

<p>In this section, we consider a special case when $m$ is a prime number, and we will describe a method that can calculate all the Modular inverse of every number in range $[1, m-1]$.</p>

<p>Applying the algorithms described in previous sections, we obtain a solution with complexity $O(m log m)$. Here we present a better algorithm with complexity $O(m)$. The method is as follows: We denote by $r[i]$ the Modular inverse of $i$. Then when $i > 1$, we have:</p>

<p>$r[i] = - \lfloor \frac{m}{i} \rfloor . r[m \, mod \, i]. \; (mod \, m)$</p>

<p>The implementation is very simple:</p>

<pre><code class="cpp">r[1] = 1;
for(int i = 2; i &lt; m; ++i)
    r[i] = (m - (m/i) * r[m%i] % m) % m;
</code></pre>

<h3>Proof</h3>

<p>We have:</p>

<p>$m \, mod \, i = m -  \lfloor \frac{m}{i} \rfloor . i$</p>

<p>Then, taking mod m of both sides yield:</p>

<p>$m \, mod \, i = - \lfloor \frac{m}{i} \rfloor . i \; (mod \, m)$</p>

<p>Multiply both sides by Modular inverse of i and then by Modular inverse of $(m \, mod \, i)$ yield:</p>

<p>$r[i] = - \lfloor \frac{m}{i} \rfloor . r[m \, mod \, i] \; (mod \, m)$</p>
